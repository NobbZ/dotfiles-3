This repo provides a [nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) which [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS) and [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration, along with an overlay for packages.

You can directly reference this flake and import it into your NixOS configuration, but you may want to copy code snippets instead.

- [modules](modules): NixOS and home-manager modules to import into the configurations. Generic config files are stored into [moudules/misc](modules/misc).
- [overlay](overlay): Nixpkgs/overrides packaged by me for personal use. Can be imported into any flake.
- [lib](lib): Nix utility functions.
- [bin](bin): Various scripts
- [templates](templates): Template files for various projects.
- [.img](.img): A look into the past
