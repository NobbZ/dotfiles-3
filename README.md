# üóí About
These are my personal configuration files for my Linux and Windows machines. Feel free to grab anything that you find interesting.

# ‚ùÑ Installation

<div align="center">
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
    <img alt="Nix logo" src="https://nixos.org/logo/nixos-logo-only-hires.png" width="20%">
  </div>
</div>

Most of the configuration files are managed with a [Nix Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) and [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), which is self-contained, distro-agnostic and doesn't require any additional software apart from the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html).

First install, with no nix installed can be done with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/viperML/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles $ sh bin/install.sh
```

Any subsequent updates can be done with:
```bash
~/.dotfiles $ git fetch && git pull
<at any dir> $ home-manager switch --flake ~/.dotfiles
```


That is how I install it myself, but I don't recommend it for you. Instead, pick any specific files or snippets of code.
